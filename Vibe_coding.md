Write a Google App Script program for lesson planning based on a textbook, I have a text file for the textbook and I want the app script to generate lesson plans or summaries of concepts that the user specifies in a text box. Provide an app script code file for back end, and an HTML file for front end. The final user interface should be a website where the user can upload a txt file of a textbook and then generate lesson plans for a topic or summaries of a topic. 
I want a nice ui design using modern ui libraries. The back end should use the keras gpt 2 function.
