Lesson 1

Cells

What are plants and
animals made of?
All living things are made of
cells (SELZ). A cell is the smallest
part of a living thing that can carry
out life activities. That is, they take
in food and grow.
Plant cells often have boxlike shapes
that ﬁt closely together. This arrangement
provides support for a plant.

Cells are the building blocks
that all living things are made of.
For example, your body is made of
trillions of cells. A pet dog or cat
is made of cells. A tree and even a
blade of grass are made of cells.
There are different kinds of
cells. Cells that make up plants are
able to make food for a plant. They
can store water. Cells that make up
animals allow for taking in food,
since animals do not make their
own food.

Animal cells have more rounded shapes
than plant cells. Their shapes allow
for movement.

How can cells be seen?
Cells are so small that you need
a microscope (MIGH•kruh•skohp) to
see them. A microscope makes
things look bigger. Cells were first

seen under a microscope over 400
years ago. It took almost 200 years
of observing cells for scientists to
understand that all living things are
made of cells.

Microscope Timeline
1940s—Electron
microscopes

staining cells so
they are easier to
see and study under
a microscope.

1665—English scientist Robert
Hooke studies slices of cork,
calling the tiny boxes that he sees
“cells” after a Latin word that
means “little rooms.”

From Cells to Organisms

How are living things organized?
The word we use for any individual living thing
is organism (AWR•guh•nizm).
An organism can carry out the basic life
processes. The life processes are the abilities
to do things that keep an organism alive and to
produce more of its own kind.

Life Processes in Living Things
Growth

The ability to get bigger

Response

The ability to react to changes in the surroundings

Reproduction

The ability to produce offspring—that is, more of its
own kind

Nutrition

The ability to take in food or raw materials to support
the other life processes

Respiration

The ability to release energy
from inside the food

Excretion

The ability to get rid of waste

Kinds of Organisms
Remember, cells are the smallest part
of a living thing. So, cells are the smallest
part of an organism. Based on the number
of cells, there are two kinds of organisms:
• one-celled organisms A one-celled
organism carries out all its life processes
in a single cell. One-celled organisms live
in water, soil, and even on dust in the air.
• many-celled organisms People and
all animals and plants are many-celled
organisms. In a many-celled organism,
each cell carries on life processes.
However, the cells work together to do
different jobs. For example, muscle
cells in your heart work to keep your
heart beating.

Diatoms are one-celled
organisms. They are found in
fresh water and salt water. You
need a microscope to see them.

All plants and all
animals, such as this
mountain lion cub are manycelled organisms.

How do cells work together?
Many celled organisms are made of different kinds of
cells—such as blood cells, muscle cells, nerve cells, and so
on. Each of these kinds of cells has a particular job.
Cells of the same kind work together doing their
particular job. A group of the same kind of cells that do the
same job is called a tissue (TISH•ew). Examples include:
• animals muscle tissue (which allows you to move), blood,
nerves, bone, and skin
• plants tissue that carries water from roots to stems to
leaves, flesh of fruits.

Diversity of Organisms

How are living things
grouped together?
There are millions of kinds of living
things on Earth. To show how living
things are alike, scientists classify
them. Classifying means “putting into
groups” based on how alike the living
things are.
One way scientists classify
living things is to put them into six
kingdoms. A kingdom is the broadest
group into which living things
are classified.
Members of the same kingdom are
then divided into smaller and smaller
groups. The smaller the group, the
more alike its members are.

The scientiﬁc name of a horse is Equus
caballus, from its genus (Equus) and
species (caballus).

• a kingdom is divided into phyla
(singular, phylum).
• a phylum is divided into classes
• a class is divided into orders
• an order is divided into families
• a family is divided into genera
(singular, genus)
• a genus is divided into species

What do animals have in common?
All animals belong to one kingdom, the Animal
Kingdom. How are all animals like?
• All animals are many-celled living things.
• All animals get energy from eating other
living things.
There of so many different kinds of animals
that scientists divide them into many phyla (that
is, smaller groups). Many of the phyla are made up
of invertebrates (in•VUR•tuh•brayts). An invertebrate
is an animal that does not have a backbone. The
table lists phyla that are made up of invertebrates.

12
Structure of Living Things

The body of a sponge is a
hollow tube with small holes.
Sponges trap food that is
carried into their bodies
by water.

Arthropods have a hard outer
skeleton and jointed legs (legs
that can bend where parts are
connected). Their bodies are in
sections. A spider has 2 body
sections and 8 jointed legs.

Phylum Chordata
Animals we are most familiar
with—such as frogs, dogs, cats, and
horses—belong to another phylum,
Chordata (KAWR•day•ta). Members
of this phylum have a supporting
rod that runs the length of their
body for at least part of their life.
This phylum includes some
unusual water-dwellers such

as sea squirts. Sea squirts are
invertebrates. However, most
members of this phylum are
vertebrates (VUR•tuh•braytz). A
vertebrate is an animal that has a
backbone.
This phylum is divided into many
classes. Here are the classes that
are made up of vertebrates.

Animal Kingdom: Phylum Chordata
Classes with Backbones

Chapter 1 • Lesson 3

What are plants?
All plants are many celled living
things. They can all produce their
own food.
Most common plants are
vascular (VAS•kyuh•luhr) plants.
Vascular plants have tubes running
up and down inside. The tubes
bring water and minerals from the
ground up to roots and stems into
the leaves. They bring food from

the leaves to other parts of the
plant.
On the other hand, mosses are
nonvascular (non•VAS•kyuh•luhr)
plants. Nonvascular plants do not
have tubes for moving water and
other materials. They soak up water
directly from the soil into their cells.
To do so, they must grow very
close to the ground.

Plant Kingdom

Nonvascular Plants

Vascular Plants

Examples: mosses, liverworts,
hornworts

Examples: ferns, pine trees, all
ﬂowering plants

Mosses do not have true roots,
stems or leaves with vascular
tissue. Most grow close to the
ground.

Vascular plants can grow tall
because their tubes can bring
food and water to wherever
they are needed.

What are fungi?
Mushrooms often grow from the ground. So
people often mistake them for plants. However, a
mushroom is not a plant. It is a fungus (FUNG•guhs).
A fungus cannot make its own food, as plants can.
A fungus absorbs food from dead organisms in
their surroundings. Fungi (FUN•ji), which means
more than one fungus, can be one celled or many
celled. They can be helpful or harmful.

Helpful Fungi

Harmful Fungi

• Some break down dead organisms into
materials that enrich soil

• Wild mushrooms can be poisonous.

• Yeasts can make bread rise.

• Some cause disease, such as
athlete’s foot.

• Some are used in medicines, such as
this mold, which produces penicillin.

• Some attack crops, such as wheat rust
and this corn smut.

What are bacteria?
Bacteria (bak•TEER•ee•uh) are one-celled living
things. Remember that cells have a part called a
nucleus, the cell control center. Bacteria do not have
a nucleus. They do have other parts, such as a cell
membrane and cytoplasm. Most have cell walls.

Bacteria make up two kingdoms. True bacteria
may cause diseases. However, many are helpful
such as bacteria in your digestive system that help
you digest food. Bacteria are used to produce
yogurt and other foods.

• some break down dead organisms, like fungi
However, they are much simpler than plants,

What are vascular plants?
Trees, bushes, grass, and plants with vegetables or
fruits are all vascular plants. A vascular plant has special
tissues that form thin tubes inside the plant. These tubes
carry water and other materials up and down the plant.
These tubes connect the three main parts of a
vascular plant:
roots Roots have several jobs:
• anchor plants to the ground
• take in water and minerals from the soil
• store food made by the plant (in some plants)
stems Stems have several jobs:
• support the plant above ground
• move materials from the roots to the
leaves and from the leaves to the roots
leaves Leaves have one main job:
• make food for the plant

Classifying Vascular Plants
There are two ways vascular plants reproduce, that
is, form offspring (more of their own kind).
seedless plants Plants such as ferns do not have seeds.
They grow from spores (spawrz). A spore is a single cell
that can develop into a new plant. The new plant is
exactly like the plant that produced the spore.
seed plants Most familiar vascular plants make and
grow from seeds. A seed contains an undeveloped plant
and stored food inside a protective coat. Some seed
plants produce flowers. Some do not.

Chapter 2 • Lesson 1

How are seedless and seed
plants different?
Mosses, ferns, and horsetails are seedless plants.
They grow from spores. Here is an example.
• On a fern, spores are found in spore cases on the
underside of a fern leaf (a frond).
• When a spore case opens, many spores come out.
Some fall to the ground. Some are carried by wind.
• Spores grow into new ferns, just like the parent fern,
if they land in moist soil.
Grasses, trees, and flowering plants are seed plants.
• Seed plants produce two special kinds of cells: male
cells and female cells.
• A seed forms when a male cell and a female cell join
together into one cell.
• Inside a seed there is a new, undeveloped plant, as well
as food. The new plant shares characteristics of the
two cells that joined when the seed was made.

Plant Structures and Functions

Classifying Seed Plants
Most seed plants produce flowers.
Some do not.
Seed plants that produce
flowers are called angiosperms
(AN•jee•uh•spurmz). There are over
235,000 kinds of angiosperms, from
rose plants to orange trees.
Seed plants that do not produce
flowers are called gymnosperms
(JIM•nuh•spurmz). Gymnosperms
produce seeds inside a cone. When
the cone falls, the seeds are released.
Evergreens are gymnosperms.
These trees lose their leaves slowly
all year. When a leaf is lost, a new
one grows back. So, these trees look
green all year.

What do flowers do?
When you think of flowers, you may think of bright
colors and sweet scents. Flowering plants use their
flowers for reproduction, that is, making new plants.
The diagram shows the parts of a flower:
• stamen The stamen (STAY•men) is the male part of a
flower. It produces male cells called pollen grains.
• pistil The pistil (PIS•tuhl) is the female part of a
flower. It produces female cells called egg cells.
• ovary The ovary (OH•vuh•ree) is the bottom part
of the pistil. Egg cells are found in the ovary.
Seeds will form in the ovary. To learn how, follow
the steps on the next page.

Seeds
Look back at the diagram as you follow the steps.
1. pollination Pollen grains collect on the top of a
stamen. They are moved to the pistil of the same flower
or another flower. Pollination (pol•uh•NAY•shuhn) is the
movement of pollen grains from a stamen to a pistil.
What moves the pollen grains?
• wind
• insects and birds are attracted to flowers by the
colors and smells. They brush up against the stamens
and pick up the pollen grains on their bodies. They
drop the grains onto other flowers.
2. making a seed When a pollen grain reaches a pistil,
it travels down into the ovary. A pollen and an egg
cell can then join and form a seed. The ovary slowly
enlarges, becoming a fruit with the seeds inside.
3. scattering seeds Seeds are then scattered by wind
or animals.
If a seed reaches a place where the soil is moist and
the temperature is just right, the new plant inside begins
to grow.

Plant Transport Systems

How do materials move in plants?
A tree may look still. However, materials are moving
inside a tree. Vascular plants have tubes running through
the roots, stems, and leaves. These tubes bring materials
up to the leaves. The leaves make food (sugar). The
sugar then is carried to the rest of the plant.

Transport in Vascular Plants

Reading Diagrams
Root The roots take in
water and minerals from
the soil.
Stem (or Trunk) Follow
the upward arrow. Tubes
move water and minerals
up from roots to the
leaves.
Leaf Food (sugar) is
made in the leaves.
Stem (or Trunk) Follow
the downward arrow.
Tubes move the sugar to
all parts of the plant.

28
Plant Structures and Functions

Roots
Inside a root, are tiny tubes made of vascular
tissue. Toward the center, xylem (ZIGH•luhm) moves
water and minerals up from the ground through the
root to the stem.
Around the center, phloem (FLO•em) carries sugar
from the leaves down the stem and into the root.
Roots come in many sizes and shapes. Carrots and
beets have thick taproots that grow deep into the
soil. Grasses have thin, fibrous roots. Corn plants have
finger-like prop roots.

Chapter 2 • Lesson 2

What is the transport system made of?
You saw that a root has two kinds of tubes made
from vascular tissue, xylem and phloem. They continue
up from the root all the way through the stem.
In different kinds of stems, the xylem and phloem
are arranged differently. See the diagram. There is a
layer of cells called cambium (KAM•be•uhm) in both
stems. Cambium is where new cells of xylem and
phloem are made.

Tree Rings
A tree stump gives you a view of
the outside and inside of a woody
stem, a tree trunk.

Counting tree rings gives you the
age of a tree. The oldest living tree
is a bristlecone pine in California. It
is 4,767 years old. B

• bark Along the outside is a layer of
bark. Bark protects the trunk.
• phloem Just inside the bark is a
layer of phloem.
• xylem Inside the phloem are rings.
The rings are layers of xylem.
A ring of xylem grows every year.
So by counting the rings you can tell
the age of the tree. Start from the
inside, the oldest part. Each ring has
two parts.
• light part The lighter part grows
in the spring when water is usually
plentiful.
• dark part The dark part grows in
the fall when there is less rain.

What do leaves do?
A leaf is a factory that makes food (sugar). To make
food, a leaf needs two raw materials: water and carbon
dioxide.
Look at the diagram to see how a leaf gets these two
raw materials:
• veins A plant takes in water from the soil. The water
travels up the xylem through the roots and the stem.
The xylem goes into a leaf through narrow veins. Water
enters the leaf through the xylem.
• stomata Stomata (STOH•muh•tuh) are tiny holes in the
bottom of a leaf or stem. (The word for one hole is
stoma.) The stomata are surrounded by guard cells.
When the guard cells open the stomata, carbon dioxide
comes in. Guard cells can close the stomata to keep a
plant from drying up.

layer of a leaf. (It is also made in cells of some stems.)
Food is made in chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are cell
parts with a green substance that traps sunlight.
• what happens Carbon dioxide and water enter the
chloroplasts. In the presence of sunlight, these two raw
materials combine. They form sugar and oxygen.
carbon dioxide + water + energy

sugar + oxygen

• after it happens Phloem carries the food to all parts of
the plant. Oxygen goes out the stomata.

Chapter 2 • Lesson 3

What is a cycle in plants and animals?
In photosynthesis, a plant makes food (sugar) and
oxygen. These two products are used by the plant, and
also by animals.
• sugar (food) The food has energy stored in it. Animals
that eat plants take in the food with its stored energy.
Other animals that eat plant-eaters also get the food
and stored energy.
• oxygen Plants and animals use oxygen for the process
of respiration (res•puh•RAY•shuhn) in cells. Respiration in
cells is the release of energy from food.
Respiration takes place in the parts of a cell
called mitochondria. Oxygen and sugar go into the
mitochrondria. The oxygen breaks down the sugar and
energy is given off. Two waste products are made in the
process: carbon dioxide and water.

The Digestive System

What is digestion?
Every cell in your body needs energy to live and grow.
This energy comes from food. However, food has to be
broken down into a form your cells can use. Breaking
down food into simpler substances that your body can
use is called digestion (die•JES•chuhn).
Here is how food reaches your cells:
1. When you bite into and chew food:
• your teeth and tongue break the
food into small pieces
• chemicals in your mouth break
down some of the food into nutrients.
A nutrient is a simple form of food that
your cells can use.
2. The process continues in other organs
where food is broken down further.
3. The nutrients eventually pass into your
blood. Blood carries them to your cells.
The nutrients give your cells energy
and materials for growing.

Your digestive system starts
working on food in your mouth.

Chapter 3 • Lesson 2

How does it start?
When you eat an apple
• your front teeth bite into it and tear it
• your back teeth grind and crush it
• your back teeth and tongue roll the food
into a ball, called a bolus.
Your mouth produces saliva (seh•LIE•vuh). Saliva helps
to moisten and soften the bolus and starts to break it
into some nutrients. The bolus then reaches the pharynx
(FAR•ingks) in the throat.
The bolus then enters the esophagus (i•SOF•uh•guhs).
The esophagus is long, muscular tube that moves food
into the stomach.
Salivary Glands
produce saliva.

Nose helps you
taste food.

Teeth of different

The Stomach
The bolus enters the stomach. The stomach is a
digestive organ with muscular walls.
• The walls of the stomach produce chemicals that break
down the bolus further into nutrients.
• The muscles in the walls of the stomach squeeze
(contract) and relax over and over. This muscle action
mixes up the bolus with the chemicals.
After about 4 to 6 hours of squeezing and mixing, the
bolus has become a thick, soupy liquid. The liquid then
moves into the next digestive organ.

Chapter 3 • Lesson 2

How is food broken down further?
When food leaves the stomach, it moves into
an organ that has folds in its walls. That organ is
the small intestine. The small intestine is a long,
coiled tube-like organ. The folds are a clue to
what happens there.
Other parts of the digestive system pour
digestive juices into the small intestine:
• the pancreas adds juices that digest most
kinds of foods.
• the liver adds bile, which breaks up fats.
As food moves through the long small
intestine:
1. the juices mix with food until it is all
broken down into nutrients.
2. the folds in the walls of the small
intestine soak up the nutrients.
The ﬁngerlike folds in the walls
of the small intestine soak
up nutrients.

3. In the folds, the nutrients pass into
tiny blood vessels. Blood carries the
nutrients to the cells.

What is the large intestine?
Not everything that you chew is digested. Undigested
parts of the food are a form of waste. This waste moves
from the small intestine into the large intestine. The
large intestine is a thick tube-like organ that removes
undigested waste from the body.
In this organ, wastes move through three parts:
• cecum (SEE•kuhm)
• colon (KOH•luhn)
• rectum (REK•tuhm)
Solid waste, feces (FEE•seez), is pushed out from the
rectum. It leaves the body through the anus (AY•nuhs).
This process is called elimination (i•li•muh•NAY•shuhn).

The Respiratory System

What does the respiratory system do?
You breathe all the time, even while you sleep.
Breathing is a job of your respiratory system. This
system works to take in oxygen from the air and bring
it to your blood. Your blood brings oxygen to all your
cells. Here’s how it works:
• You have a muscle, the diaphragm
(DIGH•uh•fram), that works to pull air
in and push air out of your body,
• When the diaphragm pulls down,
you inhale (in•HAYL). Air enters your
mouth and nose and fills your lungs,
the main organs for breathing.
• In the lungs, oxygen passes into the
blood. The blood, in turn, drops off
carbon dioxide, a waste gas, into
your lungs.
• When the diaphragm moves back
up, you exhale. The carbon dioxide is
pushed out of your body

When you blow up a balloon, you are
exhaling air with carbon dioxide.

Where are gases exchanged?
As you inhale, air enters your nose and mouth. Air
follows this path:
• Air moves through the trachea (TRAY•chee•uh), a thick
tube that leads into smaller and smaller tubes, ending
with the bronchi (BRONG•kigh).
• The bronchi lead to air sacs called alveoli (al•VEE•uh•ligh).
The alveoli are surrounded by tiny blood vessels,
capillaries (KAP•uh•ler•eehs).
• In the alveoli, oxygen from the air goes into the blood
in the capillaries. Carbon dioxide leaves the blood and
enters the alveoli. Carbon dioxide is exhaled.

The Circulatory System

How does blood transport
materials?
Your circulatory system is a “delivery
system.” Red blood cells travel in the blood,
bringing things to and from your
body cells.
• The main organ of the system is heart. The
heart is a muscular organ that constantly
pumps blood throughout the body.
• Blood vessels called arteries (AHR•teer•ees)
carry blood away from your heart. Blood in an
artery brings oxygen and food to body cells.
• Arteries lead to capillaries, the thinnest blood
vessels. Here oxygen and food pass into body
cells. The body cells release wastes, such as
carbon dioxide, into the blood.
• The capillaries now lead to the veins (VAYNZ).
A vein is a blood vessel that carries blood
back to the heart.

Red blood cells are
the messengers of the
circulatory system.

How can systems work together?
The circulatory and respiratory systems work together.
Here’s how:
• Veins bring blood into an upper “chamber” of the heart
called an atrium (AY•tree•uhm).
• From an atrium, blood flows through a valve to a lower
“chamber,” called a ventricle (VEN•tri•kul).
• Blood is pumped out of the ventricle through an artery.

What is blood?
Blood looks like a red liquid.
However, it is made of a liquid
and cells.
• Plasma (PLAZ•muh) is a clear liquid.
It makes up just over half of your
blood. Plasma carries the solid
parts of the blood. It also carries
nutrients from your digested food
to all your cells.
• Red blood cells make up just less
than half your blood. Red blood
cells carry oxygen to all the cells
of your body. They pick up carbon
dioxide from your cells and bring
it to the lungs.
• White blood cells make up a small
amount of your blood. They fight
germs that enter the body.
• Platelets (PLAYT•lits) are small
pieces of cells. They clump
together to form a scab or clot
when you cut yourself.

How do vessels and
valves work?
Blood vessels form an unbroken
path for blood.
• Arteries are thick-walled vessels
leading away from the heart.
• Veins, which lead blood back to the
heart, are thinner-walled. They are
still thick enough to keep materials
from passing through.
• Capillaries connect arteries to veins.
They have thin walls. So nutrients
can pass through the walls. So can
oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Structure of Vein Valves
vein valve

Heart Valve

Many veins have valves. These
valves close up as needed to keep
blood from backing up in the wrong
direction. They then open to let blood
flow in the correct direction.
Valves in the heart do much the
same. They let blood flow from an
atrium to a ventricle. However, they
close to keep blood from flowing back
in the wrong direction.
Heart valves are like doors between
chambers of the heart. They keep blood
from ﬂowing in the wrong direction.

The Excretory System

What is the excretory system?
Your body produces wastes. Your excretory system
gets rid of these wastes This system is really several
systems:
• solid waste from digestion Remember, this waste
leaves through the end of the large intestine (digestive
system).
• carbon dioxide from body cells Remember, you exhale
this waste from your lungs (respiratory system).
• liquid wastes from body cells The urinary
(YUR•uh•ner•ee) system gets rid of these wastes:
1. These wastes are carried in the blood from the
liver to the kidneys. The kidneys (KID•nees) are two
bean-shaped organs that filter these wastes out of
the blood.
2. The kidneys then produce urine (YUR•in). Urine is
waste and water.
• sweat Sweat is water, salts, and wastes. It leaves
your body through your skin system.
This lesson is about how urine and sweat leave
the body.

The picture at the right is one

parts of the nephron.

How does your kidney work?
All your blood passes through your kidneys about
60 times a day! Your kidneys remove substances from
the blood that your body no longer needs. They also
return to the blood substances your body does need.
Here’s how:
1. An artery brings blood into a kidney. The artery
branches into capillaries. The capillaries bring
blood to the nephrons (NEF•rons). A nephron is
the part of a kidney where waste materials are
separated from useful materials in the blood.

62
The Human Body

2. Wastes from the blood move
out from the capillaries into the
nephron. The wastes flow through
a collecting duct. Collecting ducts
from all the nephrons join into the
ureter. The ureter leads the waste
(urine) out of the kidney.
3. At the nephron, useful substances
that may have been removed
from the blood pass back into the
capillaries. These capillaries lead
blood to a vein. The vein carries the
cleaned blood out of the kidney.

If Kidneys Stop Working
Sometimes the kidneys may stop
working properly. Wastes can build up in
the blood to dangerous levels. People
with this problem may need dialysis
(digh•AL•uh•sis).

Dialysis removes dangerous wastes
from this patient’s blood.

Dialysis is a treatment that uses a machine
to do the job of the kidneys.

How does your body get rid of
liquid wastes?
Your urinary system is like a drainage system. Your
kidney collects wastes from the blood and forms urine.
• A tube called a ureter (yu•REE•tuhr) leads the urine out
of the kidney
• The ureter brings urine into the bladder. Urine collects
in the bladder for several hours.
• When the bladder is holding a lot of urine, eventually it
is released into the urethra (yu•REE•thruh), The urethra
carries urine from the bladder to outside the body.

The Skin
Liquid waste also leaves your body through the skin.
Sweat is made up of water, salts, and other wastes.
Follow what happens in the skin diagram.
• Blood in the capillaries carries wastes. The wastes
collect in a sweat gland.
• Sweat from the gland is pushed upward. It reaches the
surface through an opening, called a pore (PAWR). At
the surface it collects as droplets.
• The sweat evaporates from the surface. That is, the
liquid turns into a gas and goes into the air. As the
liquid turns into gas, it takes heat away from the skin.
As heat is removed, your skin cools down.

Earth: The Blue Planet

How much of Earth is covered with water?
From California’s coast, the Pacific Ocean stretches as
far as you can see. An ocean is a large body of salt water.
The map shows that most of Earth’s surface, about 70%,
is covered with oceans. The remaining 30% is mostly land,
with some water on the land.
Oceans are very useful. They provide:
• food, such as fish, shrimp, and seaweed
• fuels, such as oil from the ocean bottom
• recreation and transportation

Fresh Water

Ocean water flows uninterrupted
around Earth. However, scientists
have divided ocean water into
several oceans because of the
land between them, as well as
how salty they are.

The white covering on
Greenland and Antarctica on the
map represents huge sheets of ice.
These ice sheets are made of fresh
water. Fresh water contains little or
no salt.

The biggest and deepest is the
Pacific Ocean. One spot near the
Philippine Islands is 11,033 meters
(36,198 feet) deep. The Atlantic
Ocean is only about half the size
of the Pacific.

If 100 pennies represented all
of Earth’s water, only 1 penny, 1%,
is fresh water. Most fresh water is
frozen. The small amount of fresh
water is found in rivers and lakes.
However, Mono Lake contains

What Makes Oceans Salty

rain

tributaries

river

What makes oceans salty?
Rain water falling on a mountain is fresh. However,
as the water flows downhill, it picks up salt from soil
and rocks.
The flowing water forms tributaries (TRIB•yuh•ter•eez).
A tributary is a small river or stream that flows into
a larger river. The larger river flows into the ocean.
River water does not taste salty because it has a small
amount of salt. However, it carries the salt into the
ocean all the time.
Along a coast, waves pound on rocks and sand. The
pounding waves pick up salt, adding salt to the oceans.

Sunlight shines on the oceans. Water
at the surface is heated. This heat
causes evaporation (i•vap•uh•RAY•shuhn).
Evaporation is the changing of a liquid
to a gas. Water at the surface of the
ocean is slowly changing to a gas, water
vapor. Water vapor is water in the form
of a gas. You can’t see it or taste it.
As liquid water turns into water
vapor, it rises out of the ocean. It goes
into the air. The salt stays behind. The
remaining water becomes saltier and

The Water Cycle

What makes water change form?
You may think of water as only a liquid. However,
water can be in three forms, or states:
• solid (ice)
• liquid (water in a glass or lake)
• water vapor (invisible gas in the air)
Water can change states. Start with ice, such as
ice on a pond in winter. When the pond heats up in
spring and summer, the ice melts. It becomes liquid.
Heat can also make liquid water in the pond change
to water vapor.
Heat is removed as the pond and the air above
it get colder from summer to fall and winter. Water
vapor in cooled air turns back into liquid and can
fall as rain or snow. Changing a gas to a liquid is
condensation (con•den•SAY•shuhn). As months get
colder, more heat is removed from the pond. The
pond freezes again.

What happens to water after
it evaporates?
When water evaporates, it goes up into the air.
If the air is moving, the moving air can carry it
away. Moving air is wind or a breeze. What makes
air move?
Air is made up of particles of gases, such as
oxygen. When heat is added to air, the particles
move faster and spread apart. Compare the number
of particles of gas in the same amount of warm
air and cold air in the diagram. Cold air has more
particles than the same amount of warm air.
Cold air is packed with more particles than the
warm air is. Because cold air has more particles in it,
cold air is heavier than an equal amount of warm air.
So, cold air sinks while warm air rises.

How do clouds form?
The air around you may look
empty. However it is not. It is filled
with invisible particles of gases,
such as oxygen. It also contains
invisible particles of water vapor.
Remember, water vapor is water in
the form of a gas.

How Clouds Form

condensation

The water vapor is produced
when liquid water is heated.
Evaporation takes place. Particles
of water vapor rise and slowly lose
heat energy. They become colder
and get closer together.
Eventually, condensation takes
place. The particles of water vapor
collect around dust in the air. When
they collect, they form droplets of
liquid water. You have seen these
droplets form on a cold glass or
window.
When more and more droplets
of water collect, you eventually see
a cloud. The more droplets there
are, the larger the cloud becomes.

Different Kinds of Clouds

Cirrus Clouds

Clouds come in different shapes.
Their shape depends on how high
they form in the sky and what the
temperature is. Air is colder higher
up than closer to the ground.
Cirrus clouds, for example, form
high in the sky. They are made of
bits of ice. The bits of ice form when
liquid water in the air is cooled below
the freezing point, 0°C (32°F). It may
be so cold that water vapor turns
into ice without becoming liquid
water first.

Cirrus clouds form high in the sky. They
are thin and wispy.

Cumulus Clouds

Lower clouds are made of water
droplets. They may look dark
because they are so crowded with
droplets. Fog is a cloud that forms
near the ground.
Cumulus clouds are puffy and seem to
rise up from a ﬂat bottom.

Stratus Clouds

Stratus clouds are low-lying clouds that
spread like a blanket across the sky.

Will it rain?
When clouds are made up of liquid drops (instead of bits of
ice), the drops start to fall of their own weight. Wind pushes
them back up and they join together into heavier drops. In
time, the drops are so large and heavy, they fall to the ground
as precipitation (pri•sip•i•TAY•shuhn). Precipitation is water that
falls from the air. It can be rain, sleet, hail, or snow.
Rain falls when:
• air up above the ground is cool enough
for condensation to take place.
• the drops fall through air that is warmer than
the freezing point of water, 0°C (32°F), or the
air just above the ground is warmer than freezing.

Water on Earth is never lost. Water keeps changing
from solid to liquid to gas and then back to liquid and

into water vapor and rises into the air.
• condensation As water vapor reaches colder
air in the sky, it turns into drops of liquid water
(or bits of ice). Clouds form.
• precipitation Rain, sleet, hail, or snow falls to
Earth’s surface.
• runoff Fallen water or melted snow may soak
into the ground. However, much of it runs over
the ground. It collects into rivers, which bring
water to the ocean. The cycle keeps going.

Where is freshwater found?
Much of Earth’s fresh water is frozen in huge sheets of
ice or glaciers (GLAY•shurz). A glacier is a large sheet of ice
that moves slowly across the ground. This fresh water is
far away from towns and cities. So where does the fresh
water you use come from?

Running Water
Most towns and cities are built near streams and rivers.
These forms of running water bring rain water and melted
snow from mountains to homes, farms, and businesses.

Standing Water
Standing fresh water fills up holes in the ground.
Examples are, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs (REZ•uhr•vwahrs).
A reservoir is a human-made lake that is used to store
water. Reservoirs are often made by building a dam across
a river.

Reading Diagrams
Read and compare the labels. Look for
two human-made structures that are
used to get fresh water.

river

Groundwater
Many towns, farms, and factories depend on groundwater,
water beneath the surface. As rainwater seeps down into the
ground, it eventually reaches a layer of rock that it cannot
seep through. Groundwater builds up above that layer,
forming a water table.
Groundwater may collect in an aquifer (AK•wuh•fuhr). An
aquifer is an underground layer of rock or soil that holds
water. People dig wells to reach an aquifer or the water table.

What is a watershed?
Each day, about 16 trillion liters (4.2 trillion gallons)
of rain water falls on the United States. Three things
happen to this water:
• two-thirds of it evaporates back into the air
• a small amount seeps into the ground
• the rest runs over land and drains into rivers.
The area of land in which water drains into a river is
called a watershed. As water flows through a watershed:
• it replaces water that rivers and lakes lose through
evaporation
• some of it seeps into the ground and adds to the
supply of groundwater
• it fills water sources for people.

Towns and farms are found in
watersheds.

The Flow of Water
Plants help control the flow of
water in a watershed. Roots grow
down and hold soil in place. Soil
with roots can soak up water that
runs downhill. If plants are removed,
such as by building roads or
sidewalks, water can flow faster and
carry away soil.
Fast-flowing water can enter a
river faster than the river can carry it
away. A flood can happen. A flood is
the pouring of water over the banks
of a body of water and spreading
over the land. Floods carry away
things and cover streets and homes
with water.

Water can cover the land for days
after a ﬂood.

On the other hand, during
dry periods, streams that feed
watersheds may dry up. People who
rely on these streams face a water
shortage.

How is water polluted?
As water runs over land, it
soaks up substances that pollute
(puh•LEWT) the water. To pollute
means to “dirty.” Water soaks up
• chemicals used to help
crops to grow
• chemicals used to kill
harmful insects
• waste products from farms
and factories
• spilled motor oils and trash.
Polluted water flows into rivers.
It soaks into groundwater. Water
can be unsafe to use.

Water can be so polluted that almost
nothing can live in it.

Laws
City and state governments pass laws to try to keep
water safe. The U.S. government passed:
• Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, which sets rules for
keeping water safe to drink
• Clean Water Act of 1977, which made it illegal to
pollute water.

How is water cleaned?
Water that reaches homes and businesses has
been cleaned in water treatment plants. Some of
the steps used to clean water are:
• coagulation (koh•AG•yew•lay•shuhn) Sticky particles
are added to clump dirt together.
• sedimentation (sed•i•men•TAY•shuhn) Clumped dirt
falls to the bottom of a tank.
• filtration (fil•TRAY•shuhn) Water passes through
screens that trap soil and dirt.
• disinfection (DIS•in•fek•shuhn) Chemicals are added
to kill harmful bacteria.

California’s Water Supply

Where is our fresh water from?
Most rain falls in the northern part of our state.
However, most people live in the southern part.
The greatest need for water is where rain falls the
least. See the map.
The supply of water decreases when there is
a drought (DROUT). A drought is a long period of
dry weather.
Aquifers supply about one-third of our fresh
water. During a drought, we use water from
aquifers even more. Aquifers can empty out and
the ground above them may collapse.

How is our fresh water
supplied?
Local, state, and federal
governments have built ways to
store and move fresh water in our
state. Dams were built to hold
river water in reservoirs. Water is
then moved throughout the state
through aqueducts (AK•kwee•dukts).
An aqueduct is a channel built
by people to move water long
distances.

The Hoover Dam blocks the river
and forms a reservoir, Lake Mead.

For example, the California
Aqueduct is part of the State Water
Project. The U.S. government built
the Central Valley Project, which
includes the Shasta Dam. Care is
taken to protect the environment
from which the water is taken.

Water from Lake Mead travels
through the Los Angeles Aqueduct.

How can we save water?
A little more than half the
water we get in our state soaks
into the ground, evaporates, and
is used by plants. The rest, a little
less than half, is used for cites,
farms, and the environment.
The environment includes
water in rivers and lakes.

To be sure we have enough
water, many people try to save,
that is, conserve water. For
example, to save water when
we water lawns, we can grow
plants that use less water.

Earth’s Atmosphere

What is air pressure?

Layers of the Atmosphere
exosphere

Air looks empty. However, you
can feel gases in air when you wave
your hand. You can see the gases
fill a tire. Air is made of gases,
mostly nitrogen and oxygen.

thermosphere

The air that surrounds Earth is
called the atmosphere (AT•muhs•feer).
It reaches from Earth up to about
700 kilometers (435 miles).

mesosphere

The atmosphere is made up
of five layers. The layer closest
to the Earth is the troposphere
(TROP•uh•sfeer). Weather happens
here. Here gases in the air are most
crowded together. Higher up, gases
thin out.

Air Pressing Down
All the air in the atmosphere
presses onto Earth’s surface. The
amount of air pressing onto an area is
called air pressure.

less air pressure at
a mountaintop

Think of air pressure as the weight
of a column of air pressing down on
a patch of Earth’s surface. At “sea
level” on Earth’s surface, a little over
1 kilogram of air presses down onto
each square centimeter (almost 15
pounds for each square inch). That is
the air pressure at “sea level.”
High on a mountaintop, the column
of air pressing down is shorter. So it
weighs less. There is less air pressure
as you climb up.
You don’t feel this pressure because
air pressure pushes in on you in all
directions. These pushes balance each
other out.

The lengths of the arrows help you compare the
air pressure on the two places. There is less air
pressure at a mountain than at sea level. C

Chapter 5 • Lesson 1

What can make air
pressure change?
Air pressure is caused by particles of
gases in the air crowded together. Air
pressure changes when these particles
spread out or become more crowded.
• amount of space If you squeeze
air into a small space, air pressure
increases.
• height above Earth’s surface Air
pressure decreases the higher up
you go.
• temperature When air is warmed,
the particles spread out and air
pressure decreases.
• amount of water vapor The amount
of water vapor in the air is called
humidity (hew•MID•i•tee). Water vapor
weighs less than most of the other
gases in the air. So when humidity
increases, air pressure decreases.

In the smaller space, the particles
of gas are more crowded. So there
is more air pressure.

In the heated gas, the particles
move apart and are less crowed. So
warming air decreases air pressure.

What is a barometer?
Air pressure can change during any day. For example,
air pressure changes when air temperature changes.
Tools called barometers (buh•ROM•i•turs) are used to
measure air pressure and tell how it changes.
There are two kinds of barometers.
• mercury Air pressure pushes onto mercury in
a tube. Mecury is a liquid metal. As air pressure
increases, the mercury rises in the tube.
• aneroid (A•nuh•royd) Air pressure pushes onto an
airtight container. The container gets smaller as air
pressure increases.
Pilots use barometers to tell how high up their planes
are. The higher up they are, the lower the air pressure is.

Air Currents and Wind

Why are temperatures different?
One year, on the first day of spring, the temperature
was 10°C (50°F). At the same time, the temperature in
San Diego, California, was higher, 25°C (77°F). At any
one time, air temperature is different in different places
all around Earth. Why?
One reason is Earth’s shape. Earth is shaped like a
ball. Because of Earth’s ball-shape, sunlight is more
direct in some places and more slanted in others. For
example, it is most direct at the equator (i•KWAY•tuhr).
The equator is an imaginary line around Earth’s middle.
The Angle of Sunlight

The circles below help you
compare direct and slanted beams
of light. The most direct beam of
light (90°) is a small circle. This
circle focuses all its energy on a
small spot. This spot gets warmer
than light from slanted beams.
Slanted beams of light spread
out when they reach Earth. They
are ovals of light at 120° and 150°.
At 180° the light spreads way out.
When light spreads out over an area,
that place warms up less than when
light is more direct.

Seattle

Places closer to the equator get
more direct light. So places like San
Diego get more direct heat from the
Sun and are warmer than places to
the north (like Seattle) or south.

and water?
During the day along a shore, you can feel a sea
breeze coming from the sea toward land.
At night or early in the morning, you feel a land
breeze moving from land out to sea. Why?
Sea Breeze During the day land heats up faster than
water. Water stays cooler longer.
• As air over the land gets warmer, air pressure over the
land drops. Air pressure over the water stays higher
longer.
• The sea breeze moves from high pressure over the
water to low pressure over the land. That is, the sea
breeze moves:

What are global winds?
Land and water temperatures change throughout the
day because land warms up faster than water does. The
changes in air temperature cause air pressure to change
as well. As temperature goes up, air pressure goes down.
As temperature goes down, air pressure goes up.

Convection
Air always moves from areas of high pressure to areas
of low pressure. In areas of high pressure, cool air is
sinking. In areas of low pressure, warm air is rising. So as
air moves, heat is traveling along with the air.
Heat traveling through the movement of a gas or
liquid is convection (con•VEK•shuhn). When convection
happens in air, it forms winds. These can be just local
breezes or winds around the world.

Oceans and Air Temperature

How do oceans affect
temperature on land?
If you live along the coast, air
temperatures are different from places
inland. In winter it is warmer near the
coast and colder inland. In summer it
is cooler near the coast and warmer
inland. Why?
Sunlight warms both land and water.
However, water warms up more slowly
than land. That is, water stays cooler
longer than land. The air above the
water also stays cooler longer.
• So in the summer, in places near
water, air temperatures are lower
than places inland.

A Areas near the coast have warmer
winters and cooler summers than
places inland.

In winter water cools off more
slowly than land does. That is, water
stays warmer than land, and so does
the air above the water.
• So in winter, in places near water, air
temperatures are higher than inland.

What are ocean
currents?
A message in a bottle tossed
into ocean off northern California
would slowly drift south. It would
be carried south by the California
Current (KUR•uhnt). A current is an
ongoing movement of ocean water.

currents bring warm water from
the equator toward the poles. Cold
currents bring cold water from the
poles toward the equator.
Warm currents heat up the air
above the water. They warm up the
land they pass by. Cold currents
cool off the land they pass by.

What causes El Niño?
Usually there is a cold current along the Pacific
Coast of Peru in South America. The air is cool and
the air pressure is high. Winds blow toward Australia.
There water is warmer and air pressure is lower.
However, every two to seven years, a change in
the weather called El Niño happens. The cold current
along Peru sinks. The surface water is warmer. So
winds now blow toward the Americas. The winds
push moist air, heavy rains, and storms onto the west
coasts of North and South America.

Severe Weather

What causes severe weather?
You may wake up to a warm, sunny day.
However, as hours go by, the temperature may
drop. Puffy clouds appear in the western sky.
They soon are overhead and grow tall.
Why does weather change? Weather is
affected by air masses that move across
your area. An air mass is a large amount of
air that has similar temperature and humidity
throughout.
For example, an air mass may form over
warm ocean water. The air mass will be warm
and humid. Another air mass may form over
cold land. It will be cool and dry.

A Towering clouds like these indicate that a storm is
coming. It is sunny above the clouds but dark below.

112
Earth’s Weather

Fronts
Weather changes when one air
mass moves into another air mass. The
meeting place between two air masses
is called a front.

Warm Fronts A warm air mass
moves over a cold air mass. Cirrus
clouds form higher up and then
stratus clouds form closer to the
ground. There may be some light,
steady rain or snow.

How a Thunderstorm Forms

1 Fronts A cold front moves
in. Warm, humid air is pushed
up. As it rises it expands and
cools.
2 Thunderheads The warm,
humid air cools. Some of the
water vapor condenses, forming
water droplets. A cloud forms.
Heat is released and surrounding
air is warmed. This air rises even
higher and forms a thunderhead.

Lightning and Thunder
Have you ever shuffled your feet across a carpet?
Shuffling or rubbing builds up static electricity in your
body. You reach for a metal doorknob. A spark of
electricity jumps from a finger to the doorknob.
Some scientists offer a similar
explanation for lightning. Upwardmoving wind (updrafts) push
water up in a cloud. Gravity pulls
water and ice down. Particles of
water rub against particles going
down. The rubbing builds up a
charge of static electricity in the
cloud. Lightning happens when the
electricity jumps from the cloud.
Lightning heats the air around
it. The heated air expands quickly,
making the sound of thunder.

1 Warm air moves upward in a thunderhead.

2 A funnel is formed when air starts
spinning in the cloud.

What are tornadoes?
Under certain conditions, a thunderstorm can
turn into a tornado (TAWR•nay•doh). A tornado is a
spinning cloud shaped like a funnel, with winds up
to 480 kilometers (299 miles) per hour.
The photos summarize how a tornado forms.
• Warm air moves up in a thunderhead. As warm air rises,
air pressure inside the cloud becomes very low. This low
pressure pulls in air from around the cloud.
• Air flowing into the low pressure spins around in a
circle. As the air moves faster and faster, the cloud takes
the shape of a funnel.
• The tip of the funnel touches the ground. It is now
a tornado. That tip can carve through streets and
buildings. Winds can lift and carry trees, cars, and pieces
of homes.
116
Earth’s Weather

Tornadoes can happen all over
the United States. However, they
are most common in Tornado
Alley. This is a part of the country
where cold, dry air from Canada
meets warm, moist air from the
Gulf of Mexico. This meeting
can cause thunderstorms and
tornadoes.

What are hurricanes?
A thunderstorm over the Atlantic
Ocean can become a tropical storm.
A tropical storm has spinning winds
with low pressure in the center. The
low pressure pulls in water vapor
from the ocean. It pulls in air from
around the storm. The tropical storm
can become a hurricane (HUR•i•kayn).
A hurricane is a very large spinning
storm with winds over 117 kilometers
(73 miles) per hour.
A hurricane is a spiral of clouds
with a hole, or eye, at its center. The
fastest winds and heaviest rains are
near the eye. The inside of the eye is
calm. The winds can make a storm
surge (SURJ). A storm surge is a rise
in the height of the ocean around
the hurricane. A storm surge can
flood a coast.

Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 was

the United States.

A monsoon (mahn•SOON) in a seasonal wind that
brings heavy rain. Monsoons happen in Southeast Asia.
They also can happen in southwestern United States.
Fog can be severe weather if it is thick enough
to limit vision beyond a fourth of a mile. Ground fog
forms when warm air near the ground cools after
sunset. Advection fog forms when warm air is pushed
by wind over cool land or water.

Predicting the Weather

Who needs to know what
the weather will be?
You need to know what the weather will be so you
can plan your day. So do people who work outdoors—
builders, truck drivers, and letter carriers. Airplane
pilots need to know the weather to make safe takeoffs
and landings. Farmers must know the weather months
ahead of time to plan crops to plant.
How can scientists forecast (FOR•kast) tomorrow’s
weather? To forecast means to “make a guess about
what will happen based on what you know and see.”
For example, if you see something happen day after
day, you may forecast that it will happen tomorrow.
Scientists use what they know and see to forecast
the next day’s weather. They know air pressure, wind
speed and direction, air temperature, kinds of clouds,
and so on.

A Air safety depends on knowing the weather ahead of time.

What do weather fronts tell you?
Weather maps of the United States often show warm
fronts and cold fronts. A front is where one air mass is
moving into another. Fronts drag cold or warm air along
with them. You may find rain or a storm along a front.
Warm fronts are shown with red half circles. Cold
fronts are shown with blue triangles. The circles and
triangles point in the direction the fronts are moving.
Why are they moving? Global winds push air masses
along. Global winds, remember, are winds that always
blow in a given direction in a particular part of the world.

122
Earth’s Weather

Front Moving from West to East

The West to East Rule
The jet stream is a global wind
that blows across the United States.
The jet stream blows high up in the
sky, above mountains or buildings.
Winds in the jet stream blow from
west to east at speeds that can
reach over 240 kilometers (150
miles) per hour.
Jet stream winds push air masses
from west to east across the country.
So on a weather map, find the
weather in the west. If you know how
fast the winds are blowing, you can
tell how long it will take for the jet
stream to blow that weather across
the United States.

A Low Pressure System is a large mass of air
with the lowest air pressure at the center.
• Winds blow in toward the center of a low
pressure system in the directions shown by
the arrows.
• Low pressure systems are warm and
humid. They bring warm, stormy weather.

A High Pressure System is a large mass of air
with the highest air pressure at the center.
• Winds blow out from the center of a low
pressure system in the directions shown
by the arrows.
• Low pressure systems are cool and dry.
They bring dry, clear, fair weather.

The Sun

What is the Sun?

Sun

The Sun is a star. A star is an
object that produces its own energy.
That energy includes heat and light.
No other objects in space make their
own energy.
The Sun is only an average-sized
star. Many other stars are larger.
They make millions of times more
energy. Others stars are smaller and
make less energy. However, the Sun
is the only star in our solar system.
It is the largest object in our
solar system.

Earth

A If the Sun were a hollow ball, more than
a million Earths could ﬁt inside it.

130
The Solar System

The Sun looks larger than other
stars, because the Sun is much
closer. The Sun is about 150 million
kilometers (93 million miles) from
Earth. The distance from Earth to
the Sun is 1 AU, or astronomical
(as•truh•NAH•mi•kuhl) unit. The closest
other stars are about 270,000 AUs
away from the solar system.

B Two particles collide.

A Hydrogen particles
move inside the Sun.

A They lose a tiny bit of mass
and form helium. As they
do so, they give off energy.

The Sun’s Mass
We cannot “weigh” the Sun. However, we can find out
the Sun’s mass, the amount of matter in the Sun. To do
so, we need two facts:
• the time it takes a planet to go around the Sun (Earth
takes 365.24 days)
• the distance of that planet to the Sun.
With these facts, we can tell the Sun’s mass: 2 million
trillion trillion kilograms. The Sun makes up 99.8% of the
mass of our solar system.
The Sun is made up mostly of two gases. Hydrogen
makes up most of the Sun (71%). Helium makes up 27%.
Inside the Sun, particles of hydrogen are smashing
together and giving off energy. See the diagram above.

What are the parts of the Sun?
The Sun is made of layers of gases:
• the core, the Sun’s center where most of its energy
is produced. The temperature is 10 to 20 million
degrees Celsius.
• the radiation (RAY•dee•a•shuhn) layer, where energy
from the core moves out in all directions. Energy
takes millions of years to move through this layer.
• the convection layer, where gases are moving in
circles. This movement carries energy through here
in about a week.
• the photosphere (FOH•tuh•sfeer), the visible surface
of the Sun. The gases here are still very hot, but
cooler than inside, about 6,000°C (10,000°F).

The Sun’s Atmosphere
Just outside the photosphere is the Sun’s
atmosphere. It is made of:
• the chromosphere (KROH•muh•sfeer), the inner layer
of the Sun’s atmosphere. When visible, it appears as
a red circle around the Sun.
• the corona (kuh•ROH•nuh), the outer layer of the
Sun’s atmosphere. It takes on many shapes as inner
temperatures change.
Bursts of energy called solar flares stretch from
these two layers into space. Solar flares interrupt
radios, cell phones, and TV.
Sunspots are dark spots in the photosphere. They
appear dark because their temperatures are lower
than the gases around them.

The Structure of the Solar System

What is the solar system?
The solar system is made up of
the Sun and the objects that move
around it.
Objects that move around the Sun
include the eight planets and their
moons. The planets are large ball-like
bodies made up of rock and gases.
The diagram on page 135 shows the
eight planets in order from the Sun.
A moon is an object that circles a
planet. Planets may have one or more
moons—or no moons at all.
We see these objects with
telescopes (TEL•uh•skohps). A
telescope is a tool for seeing distant
objects. We build telescopes on
mountains and even send some into
space to collect pictures. Space
vehicles have explored all eight
planets.

Some planets have one moon or several moons, as
you read in the table on page 135. Some moons are
small. Others are large. Jupiter’s Ganymede is the
largest moon in the solar system.
Moons are natural satellites (SAT•uh•lights). A
satellite is an object in space that circles another
object. In addition, human-made satellites circle
Earth. They are used for communication and to
collect information about Earth.
Earth’s Moon has many craters, or dents. They
formed when other objects from space fell onto
the surface. The Moon has no atmosphere. An
atmosphere would cause small objects to burn
up on the way down to the surface.

1 mile to 500 miles wide.
• comets A comet is a mass of
rock, frozen gases, ice, and
dust. Comets have paths that
approach the Sun. As a comet
nears the Sun, a tail of gas

Gravity and Orbit

What is gravity?
Why do you fall when you trip? You fall because of
the pull of gravity between you and Earth. Gravity is a
pull between any two objects.
There is gravity throughout the solar system. For
example, there is a pull of gravity between the Sun and
each planet. The strength of gravity depends on:
• distance The closer two objects are to each other, the
greater the pull is. The pull gets weaker when objects
are farther apart.
• mass Mass means “how much matter” is in something.
The greater the total mass of any two objects is, the
stronger the pull of gravity is between the two objects.
Suppose you traveled from Earth to the Moon. Where
is gravity stronger: on Earth or on the Moon?

The astronaut, John Young, could jump
higher on the Moon than on Earth. Why?
The pull of gravity is less on the Moon.

Gravity and Weight
Measuring your weight on a
scale can help you compare gravity
on Earth and the Moon. Your
weight depends on two things:

than the total mass of you and the
Moon. So gravity is stronger on
Earth. You weigh more on Earth
than on the Moon

• your mass (in kilograms)
• what the pull of gravity is where
you are.

The huge planet Jupiter has
more mass than Earth. The pull of
gravity on Jupiter is greater than
on Earth. If you visited Jupiter,
your mass would stay the same.
However, you would weigh much
more than on Earth.

If you go to the Moon, your mass
stays the same. However, Earth has
more mass than the Moon. So the
total mass of you and Earth is more

Chapter 6 • Lesson 3

What keeps objects in orbit?
Planets travel around the Sun in almost circular paths.
Moons travel around planets in similar kinds of paths. The
path one object takes around another is called an orbit.
Objects are held in their orbits by gravity. For example,
planets are held in their orbits around the Sun by the pull
of gravity between each planet and the Sun.
The pull of gravity alone would pull a planet into the
Sun. It takes gravity and inertia (in•UR•shuh) together
to keep objects in their orbits. Inertia is a way in which
objects act when they move or stay at rest. A moving
object tends to keep moving in a straight line. An object
at rest tends to stay at rest.

Gravity and Inertia
Inertia alone would make Earth
move forward in a straight line.

Gravity and inertia together
make Earth follow this path.

Sun
Gravity alone would pull
Earth into the Sun.

140
The Solar System

Working Together
How do gravity and inertia work
together? Think of a space vehicle
orbiting Earth. Gravity is pulling
the vehicle toward Earth. However,
the vehicle and the crew don’t feel
this pull. The crew members are
weightless.
Gravity is being balanced by the
forward motion of the vehicle. In the
same way, as planets orbit the Sun,
gravity would pull them toward the
Sun. However, the forward motion of
the planets keeps them moving away
from the Sun.

This astronaut catches weightless candy while
in a space vehicle in orbit around Earth.

These two motions make planets
move in nearly circular orbits. The
shape of the orbit is an ellipse, a
flattened circle. Because the orbit is
not a perfect circle, Earth is farther
from the Sun at certain times of the
year than at other times.

What causes tides?
You have learned that there is a pull of gravity
between any two objects—such as between Earth
and the Sun. However, there is also a pull of gravity
between Earth and the Moon. Both of these pulls have
an effect on Earth.
The Moon has much less mass than the Sun, but it
is much closer to Earth. The pull between Earth and
the Moon is about twice as strong as the pull between
Earth and the Sun.
The pull is felt on Earth’s oceans. This pull causes
tides. A tide is a rise and fall of the ocean’s surface.
Most oceans have two high tides and two low tides
each 24-hour day. Earth spins on its axis all the time,
making a complete spin in one day. As any point spins
to face the Moon, ocean water bulges on that side and
the opposite side (high tides). In between the bulges
are the low tides.

Monthly Tides
Remember, the Moon is
traveling in an orbit around earth.
Twice a month, the Moon is in a
point in its orbit directly in line
with Earth and the Sun. See the
new moon and full moon in
the diagram.
At these two times, the pull
of gravity of the Sun and of the
Moon is in the same direction. This
line up of Earth-Moon-Sun causes
spring tides. In spring tides, high
tides are higher than usual and low
tides are lower than usual.
Twice each month, the Sun and
the Moon are pulling in different
directions. See the first and third
quarter moons in the diagram. The
pull of the Sun and of the Moon
cancel each other out and cause
neap tides. During neap tides the
difference between a high tide
and a low tide is smaller than any
other time.

Properties of Matter

What is matter?
Put it on a balance and the pan
goes down. Drop it into a cylinder
of water. The water level goes up.
What is it? The answer is matter.
Matter can be a solid, liquid, or
gas. Matter takes up space. The
amount of space it takes up is its
volume (VOL•yewm).
To find the volume of a liquid,
pour it into a clinder like the one
shown here. Drop a solid into the
liquid. The amount the liquid rises
is the volume of the solid. Volume
is measured in milliliters (mL)
for liquids and gases, and cubic
centimeters (cc or cm3) for solids.

48 ml
40 ml

The amount of matter in any
object is its mass. To find the mass,
put an object on a balance. Mass is
measured in grams (g).
In summary, matter is anything
that has mass and volume.

A marble is dropped into 40 mL of water.
The water level goes up to 48 mL. The
volume of the ball is 48-40, or 8 mL.

Types of Matter

Mass and Weight
When you step on a spring scale, you measure your
weight. Weight is a measure of how strongly gravity
pulls on an object. It is measured in newtons (N) or
pounds (lb).
Weight can change. It depends on the pull of gravity
on an object. On other planets, gravity is weaker or
stronger than on Earth. So an object’s weight would be
less or more than on Earth.
Weight is not the same as mass. Mass is the amount
of matter in an object. It is measured with a balance. It
always stays the same, no matter where the object is.
Volume, mass, and weight are all ways of describing
matter. These are some properties of matter.

The mass of the marble is measured with
a pan balance. It is always the same.

Chapter 7 • Lesson 1

What are states of matter?
Matter includes all solids, liquids, and gases.
Solid, liquid, and gas are the three states of
matter. They are the forms matter can take.

• solids Particles that make up a solid are
packed together tightly. They hardly move,
except to “wiggle” in place. So the shape or
volume (size) does not change.

• liquids Particles that make up a liquid can
move past each other but stay close. So the
shape of a liquid changes with the container it
is in. However, the volume does not change.

• gases Particles that make up a gas move
around freely and can spread apart. So both
the shape and the volume of a gas change to
fit the container the gas is in.

Quick Check
Match the state with the description.

Reading Diagrams
The stone is denser than water.
The cork is less dense than water.

What is density?
Both the stone and the cork in the picture are solids.
So why does the stone sink and the cork float? The
particles that make up the stone are tightly packed. The
particles that make up the cork are less tightly packed.
The rock has a greater density (DEN•si•tee) than
the cork. Density is a measure of how tightly matter is
packed in an object.
The stone and the cork have about the same size
(volume). However, the denser stone has more mass—
because it has more particles packed into its volume.
An object sinks in a liquid if it is denser than the
liquid. The stone is denser than water. An object floats in
a liquid if it is less dense than the liquid. The cork is less
dense than water.

151
Chapter 7 • Lesson 1

Can the state of matter change?
At room temperature, everything is a solid or liquid
or gas. If the temperature changes, an object’s state of
matter can change.
For example, start with something that is lower than
room temperature—ice. Hold a piece of ice in your hand.
The warmth of your hand raises the temperature of the
ice. The ice melts. That is, it changes from solid to liquid.
When a solid is warmed, its particles move faster
and faster. The solid melts when the particles flow past
each other. The temperature at which a solid changes
to a liquid is its melting point. Ice starts to melt if it is
warmed up to its melting point, 0°C (32°F).
If liquid water is cooled down to 0°C (32°F), it starts
to freeze. The temperature at which something freezes is
its freezing point.

Ice melts at 0°C (32°F).

Liquid water freezes at 0°C (32°F).

152
Types of Matter

Boiling
If you left a bowl of water uncovered in sunlight,
evaporation (i•VAP•purh•ray•shuhn) would take place.
During evaporation, warmed particles from the liquid
slowly escape into the air. The liquid becomes a gas.
Water in the form of gas is water vapor.
If you boil water, the particles of water escape into
the air quickly. The boiling point is the temperature at
which a liquid changes quickly to a gas. Water boils at
100°C (212°F).
When water vapor cools,
the particles slow down and
come closer together again.
The gas changes into a liquid.
The temperature at which a
gas changes to a liquid is the
condensing point. Some solids
change directly to a liquid
with melting.

Water boils at 100°C (212°F).

Water vapor condenses at 100°C (212°F).

Elements

What is an element?
Centuries ago, the ancient Greeks thought that all
kinds of matter were made of four simple substances.
They identified air, fire, earth, and water as the building
blocks of all matter.
Today, we know of over 100 building blocks of
matter, the elements. An element is the simplest kind
of substance, something that cannot be broken into
anything simpler. These elements are the substances
that are combined in all kinds of matter.
Some of the commonly known elements are:
• gases—oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen
• liquids (only two)—bromine, mercury
• solids (the most)—carbon, aluminum, iron, copper,
sulfur, nickel, siver, gold

Composition of Aluminum

The foil is aluminum,

Types of Matter

Names, Symbols, Atoms
The names of elements come
from many places. The element
mercury was named after a
character from ancient Roman
myths. The element californium
was named for our state.
Each element has a symbol for
its name. A symbol is made of:
• one capital letter, such as O for
oxygen, OR
• a capital letter followed by a small
letter, such as Zn for zinc.

Symbols come from many
languages—such as Latin and
Greek. For example, Au, for gold,
is from the Latin word for gold,
aurum.
Each element is made up of tiny
particles called atoms (A•tuhmz). An
atom is the smallest particle that
makes up an element and has the
properties of that element. To get
an atom, you would have to keep
breaking a piece of an element into
smaller and smaller bits.

Classifying Elements

What are atoms made of?
Remember, if you split an element into smaller
and smaller pieces, you eventually get an atom of the
element. If you could split an atom, you would see the
pieces the atom is made of.
• protons (PROH•tahns) and neutrons (NEW•trons) are
located in the center, nucleus, of an atom. Each proton
carries a positive electrical charge. Neutrons are not
charged.
• electrons (e•LEK•trahns) move around the nucleus very
quickly. Each carries a negative charge. Electrons are
very small.
The number of protons in an atom is the atomic
number. Atoms of different elements have different
atomic numbers. An atom of helium has only 2 protons.
An atom of carbon has 6 protons.
Each element has an atom with its own number of protons. The
number of protons is the same as the number of electrons.

An oxygen atom has:
• 8 protons (atomic number)
• 8 electrons
• 8 neutrons
The atomic weight = 8 + 8 = 16.

158
Types of Matter

A boron atom has:
• 4 protons (atomic number)
• 4 electrons
• 3 neutrons
The atomic weight = 4 + 4 = 8.

Atoms of each element have their own atomic
weight. The atomic weight is the sum of the protons and
neutrons of an atom. Electrons are not counted because
they have so little mass.
Atoms of some elements are found naturally as
molecules (MOL•uh•kyewls). A molecule is a particle made
of more than one atom joined together. For example,
oxygen exists as molecules. A molecule of oxygen is
made of 2 oxygen atoms joined together. The symbol for
an oxygen molecule is O2.
Molecules can be made of atoms of different
elements. For example, water molecules are made of
2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom.

Symbol: O2

Symbol: H2O

An oxygen molecule is made of 2
oxygen atoms that are joined together.

What are properties of elements?
Many elements have similar properties.
• Most elements are metals. Metals conduct heat
and electricity well. They can be bent or flattened
without breaking. They are usually solids at room
temperature. Examples are: aluminum, gold, iron,
copper, and silver.
• There are 17 nonmetals. Nonmetals do not conduct
heat and electricity well. Solid nonmetals, like
carbon, break rather than bend. Most nonmetals are
gases, like helium, oxygen, and nitrogen. Bromine is
a liquid.
• A small group of elements called metalloids
(MET•uh•loids) conduct heat and electricity, but not as
well as metals. Boron and silicon are metalloids.

Can we see atoms?
In a pinch of salt there are over a half
billion sodium atoms and a half billion
chlorine atoms. That’s how small atoms
are. We can’t see them with just our eyes.
However, we can see them with special
microscopes.
• The electron microscope, invented
in 1932, hits atoms with a beam of
electrons. It allowed us to see molecules.
• The field ion microscope, invented
in 1951, bounces electrically charged
particles called ions (EYE•ahns) on atoms.
It allowed us to see molecules and
large atoms.
• The modern scanning tunneling
microscope uses a very fine tip to grab
atoms or groups of atoms. The tip can
then drag them on a surface.

With a tunneling microscope,
28 two-atom groups were
moved onto a platinum surface
in a shape called Molecule Man.

The Periodic Table of Elements

What is the periodic table?
Suppose you wrote out the name of each element
on a card. Along with the name, you list properties of
each element. How would you organize your cards to
show which elements are alike?
Dmitri Mendeleev (DMEE•tree men•DEL•ee•ef) did just
that in the 1800s. He organized the cards in order
of increasing mass. He laid them out into rows and
columns. He found that all the elements in any column
have similar properties.
Mendeleev organized the periodic (peer•ee•OD•ik)
table. The periodic table is a chart with the elements
in rows and columns of increasing atomic number.
You see the atomic number in each box in the table.
As you go from row to row, the properties repeat
themselves (periodic refers to “repeating”).

These gases have a foul smell. They can
burn flesh and combine with metals.

gases are “inactive” elements. They

Mixtures

What is a mixture?
Trail mix is a tasty mixture
(MIKS•chuhr). A mixture is a combination
of two or more things that keep their
own properties. You can pick apart the
things that make up trail mix—such as
nuts and pretzels. Each item keeps its
taste and shape.
Trail mix is a mixture in which the
particles inside are big enough to
see. Tossed salad is another example.
These mixtures do not look the same
throughout. There may be more nuts in
one part and more pretzels in another.
In other mixtures, the particles that
are mixed together are too small to see.
Milk is an example. You cannot see the
particles inside.
Concrete is a solid mixture. It is
made up of small pieces of rocks, fine
sand, fine cement powder, and water.
The parts are thoroughly mixed into a
pourable mud that hardens into a strong
material that does not settle out.
The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada,
is made from a solid mixture,
concrete.

D Trail mix is a mixture of many
kinds of tasty snacks in one.

164
Types of Matter

To Settle or Not to Settle
The particles in some mixtures settle
out. In others, the particles do not settle
out. A suspension (suh•SPEN•shuhn) is
a mixture in which the particles settle
and separate into layers over time. For
example, shake oil and vinegar to make a
smooth suspension. Then let it sit. In time
the oil layers out on top of the vinegar.

A suspension of oil and vinegar
separates into its parts when it
stands still.

The particles in some mixtures are the
size of atoms or molecules. These mixtures
are solutions (suh•LEW•shuhns). A solution
is a mixture that stays mixed because
its particles are as small as atoms or
molecules.
You make a solution by dissolving one
substance in another, like sugar in water.
Solutions are the same throughout. If they
are liquid or gas, you can see through
them clearly.
Window cleaner is a solution.
It stays mixed. You can see
through it.

What are the parts of a solution?
Add sugar to water and stir. The sugar dissolves.
That is, it breaks into particles the size of molecules
and seems to disappear in the water. However, the
sugar is still there because the mixture is sweet.
All solutions have a part that dissolves another
part. The solvent (SOL•vuhnt) is the part that does
the dissolving, such as water. The part that gets
dissolved, such as sugar, is the solute (SOL•yewt).
The solute or the solvent can be a solid, a liquid,
or a gas. The solvent is usually the part there is
more of. For example, air is a mixture of gases.
Most of the air is nitrogen. Nitrogen is the solvent.
Other gases, like oxygen, are the solutes dissolved
in the nitrogen.

Reaching a Limit
Have you ever tried stirring table salt
into water? At first the salt dissolves.
However, as you add more, the added
salt falls to the bottom, no matter how
hard you stir.
A solvent (water) can dissolve only a
certain amount of solute (salt). At room
temperature, only 37 grams of table salt
dissolves into 100 grams of water. Extra
salt does not dissolve.
Is there a way to get the extra salt to
dissolve? One way is to use warm water.
Heating water can allow more solid solute
to dissolve.

There is a limit to how much
solute can disolve. When the
limit is reached, the extra
solute falls to the bottom.

However, heating can have the opposite effect when
the solute is a gas. For example, seltzer is a solution of a
gas (carbon dioxide) and water. Cool seltzer holds more
carbon dioxide gas than warm seltzer.

Separating Mixtures

▲ Sand and water: Sand particles cannot
pass through the holes in the filter.
Water goes through, but sand collects
on the filter.

▲ Sawdust and sand in water: Let the
mixture stand still. Sawdust floats
to the top and sand collects on
the bottom.

How can you take mixtures apart?
Make three mixtures: sand in water, sawdust and sand
in water, sugar and sand in water. Can you get the solids
back? Mixtures are physical combinations. That means
their properties do not change. So you should be able
to separate the solids from the liquid.
• One way to separate them is by filtering (FIL•ter•ing).
Filtering separates substances that have particles of
different sizes. Pour the mixture over a filter. A filter
has small holes. Small particles pass with the liquid
through the holes. Larger particles are trapped by
the filter.
• If substances have different densities, some may float
or sink in water. For example, sand is denser than
water. It sinks when the mixture is kept still. Sawdust is
less dense than water. It floats to the top.

168
Types of Matter

▲ Sugar and sand in water: Sand falls to
the bottom. Pour the liquid through
a filter. Let the water evaporate. The
sugar remains behind.

▲ Iron and sand in water: A magnet attracts
the iron filings, but not the sand.

• If you have a solid solute (like sugar)
dissolved in water, just let the solution
stand open to the air for several days.
The water evaporates and leaves the
solid solute behind.
• Suppose you spilled iron filings into
sand. You can separate the iron by using
a magnet. The magnet attracts iron,
while the sand remains behind.

Compounds

Iron in this ship combined with oxygen in the air and
formed rust, a brownish material that crumbles.

What change produces
new substances?
Have you ever seen rust on a bicycle fender or a car?
Rust forms when iron comes into contact with oxygen, a
gas in the air. Iron and oxygen combine and form rust.
Rust is a different substance from iron or oxygen,
with its own properties. For example, rust has a different
color than iron. You cannot separate the iron and oxygen
from rust as simply as you can separate parts of a
mixture.
Rust forms from a chemical change. A chemical
change is change in matter that produces substances
different from the substances you started with. To
separate the iron from the oxygen would take another
chemical change.

170
Types of Matter

Compounds
Rust forms when atoms of iron
combine with atoms of oxygen.
Rust is an example of a compound
(KAHM•pownd). A compound is
formed when atoms of two or
more elements are combined. The
chemical name of rust is iron oxide.
The name shows that rust is made
of iron and oxygen.

Chemical Changes

Sugar is another example of a
compound. Sugar molecules are
made of atoms of three elements:
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
A marshmallow is white
sugar. What happens when a
marshmallow is toasted? There is
a chemical change. In this change,
heat moves about the atoms in the
sugar to produce a black material,
the carbon, and steam. Steam is
water, a compound of hydrogen
and oxygen.

Reading Photos
The marshmallows, sugar,
are changing chemically. The
burning sticks are also changing
chemically. Both are producing
a black substance, carbon.

Quick Check

Chapter 7 • Lesson 5

How are compounds
named?
What we call rust is a compound
made from two elements—iron and
oxygen. The chemical name of rust is
iron oxide. The name comes from one
element (iron) plus a changed form of
oxide).
the other element (oxygen
iron + oxygen

iron oxide (rust)

Another example is table salt. It is a
compound made of the metal element
sodium and the gaseous element
chlorine. The chemical name of salt
uses both the element names:
sodium + chlorine
chloride (table salt)

sodium

Compounds can also be written in
a short way called a chemical formula
(FOR•myew•luh). A chemical formula
uses symbols and sometimes numbers.
For example, water is a compound of
hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O). We can
use symbols to write it as:

Water: H2O
The small 2 placed after the H
means that a molecule of water
is made of 2 atoms of hydrogen
combined with an oxygen atom.

172
Types of Matter

Mon & Di
Sometimes we add prefixes to a chemical name to help
tell one compound from another. For example, carbon and
oxygen can combine in two ways. One atom of carbon can
combine with one atom of oxygen: We put the prefix mon
with the oxygen to show one oxygen atom:
CO (carbon monoxide) is made of 1 C atom + 1 O atom.
Carbon monoxide is the dangerous gas that you must
watch out for at home.
A carbon atom can also combine with two oxygen
atoms. That forms carbon dioxide (di means “two,” as in 2
oxygen atoms). Carbon dioxide is a gas that
you release when you exhale. It is also
present in smoke.

Carbon dioxide: CO2
CO2 (carbon dioxide) is made of
1 C atom + 2 O atoms.

compounds?
There are millions of compounds all around.
Each one has its own properties. Some
properties include: density, color, and freezing,
melting, and boiling points. How a compound
changes chemically is also a property.
You can use these properties to tell one
compound from another. For example:

You can tell what is in some compounds
by the color a compound makes when it is
held in a flame. Special computers are used
today to heat compounds until they give off
colors. The colors show what elements are in
the compounds.

How are compounds used?
People today are finding many uses for compounds.
For example, crude oil is a mixture of many useful
products. It can be separated into gasoline, kerosene,
diesel fuel, heating oil, and light fuel gases. These
products are hydrocarbons (high•druh•KAHR•buhns).
Hydrocarbons are compounds of hydrogen and carbon.
We use hydrocarbons every day. We use gasoline to
run cars. We use oil and natural gas for heating. Rubber
is made of hydrocarbons. We use rubber in tires, erasers,
and the wrap on electrical wires.
Plastics are compounds made of long strings of
carbon with other elements. Plastics are used to make
paints, furniture, boats, and toys.

Clothing is made of natural
compounds of cotton and wool, as
well as of human-made compounds
like polyester or nylon.

Chemical Reactions

What are chemical changes?
Matter is going through chemical changes all
around you. That is, substances are changing into
other substances. Bread bakes. Iron rusts. Wood burns.
Milk gets sour.
A chemical change in which you start with one
substance (or more) and end up with a new substance
(or more) is a chemical reaction (ree•AK•shuhn). The
substances before the change are the reactants
(ree•AK•tuhnts). The products are the new substances
after the change.
What happens in a chemical reaction? The atoms
and molecules in the reactants are rearranged. The

An iron fence is likely to rust unless you protect it. Iron
is more reactive (ree•AK•tiv) than many other elements.
Reactive means how easily a substance takes part in a
chemical reaction.
To tell how reactive a metal is, look at any column of
metals in the periodic table. Metals become more reactive
as you go down a group. The most reactive metals are
the alkali (AL•kuh•ligh) metals, column 1. The most reactive
metal of them is francium, (Fr).

Metals and Alloys

What are metals?
About three-fourths (75%) of all the elements are
metals. Copper (Cu), silver (Ag), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al),
zinc (Zn), and lead (Pb) are some common metals. What
are metals like?
A metal is substance that is a good conductor of heat and
electricity. A conductor allows heat and electricity to flow
through easily. In addition, you can often tell metals by their
shine when they are polished.
Metals melt at different temperatures. Their melting points
make some metals very useful. For example, mercury melts
at a very low temperature, –39°C (–38.2°F). So, mercury is a
liquid at room temperature. Mercury is used in one kind of
barometer. It is the silvery liquid that rises or falls when air
pressure changes.

Copper (Cu) nuggets like these may be
the earliest metals used by humans.

Mercury (Hg) is a liquid metal at room
temperature. However, spilled mercury is
dangerous and should not be touched.

186
Changes in Matter

Useful Melting Points
When mercury is warmed,
it expands evenly. When
it cools, mercury shrinks
(contracts) evenly. Because of
this property, mercury is used
in most thermometers to show
temperature changes.

Melting Point of Gallium

However, the metal gallium
(Ga) melts at 30°C (86°F). It
stays a liquid up to a very high
temperature. It boils at 2403°C
(4357°F). So gallium is used
in thermometers that measure
high temperatures.
Metals with very high melting
points are useful because they
stay solid at high temperatures.
Titanium has a melting point
of 1668°C (3034°F). It is also
strong and lightweight. So it
is used to make aircraft and
spacecraft. Beryllium, with an
almost as high melting point,
is used for wheel brakes of the
space shuttle.

Gallium melts at the mildly warm
temperature of your hand. So it is not

What do metals have in common?
Remember, metals are good conductors of
electricity and heat. Nonmetals, on the other hand,
are good insulators (IN•suh•lay•tuhrs). An insulator helps
prevent the flow of heat and electricity. Wood and
plastic are insulators.
Inside of Power Cord

• Conducting electricity Metals
such as copper and aluminum
are used to make electrical
wires. These metals conduct
electricity from power plants

metals so that the heat can
spread evenly through the
cookware and into the food
inside them. Handles and
gloves are made of insulators
such as wood or plastic. Car
engines are made of metals.
The metal conducts heat away
so that the engines do not
overheat.

It is very reactive, so gloves are used when holding it.

Hard vs. Flexible
Glass and wood can break if you
try to bend them. However, you can
bend metal rods without breaking
them. Many metals can be rolled or
pounded into flat sheets without
shattering. Gold can be pounded
into thin sheets.
Some metals stretch into strands
of wire when they are pulled.
Copper and aluminum, for example,
are made into wires. They can also
be rolled like dough into sheets.

You may think iron is very hard.
However, most metals can be
dented. The deeper a dent is, the
softer the metal. Chromium (Cr) is
the hardest metal. Cesium (Cs) is
the softest.
Pure copper, silver, and gold
are soft. Jewelry made from these
metals is often mixed with other
metals to make a hard mixture
of metals. The mixture does not
scratch as easily as the pure metal.

What are metal compounds?
What happens when iron rusts?
Atoms of iron combine with
atoms of a nonmetal, oxygen.
The product, rust, is a compound—
iron oxide.
When silver tarnishes, silver
atoms combine with atoms of
sulfur. The product, tarnish, is a
compound called silver sulfide.
When copper atoms combine with
oxygen, tarnish is also formed—
the compound copper oxide.
Rust and tarnish gradually “eat
away” a metal. They weaken the
metal so that it crumbles.
Reactive metals are the
quickest to be “eaten away.” The
metal sodium reacts with oxygen
so fast that they must be stored in
oil to keep air out. In some cases,
the compound that forms (such as
aluminum oxide) coats the metal.
The coating protects the metal.

What are alloys?
People can improve the usefulness of some metals
melting them and mixing other elements with them. The
products, when cooled and harden, are solid mixtures
called alloys (AL•oyz). An alloy is a mixture of two or
more metals and nonmetals.
For example, mixing gold with copper, silver, or other
metals can make it stronger. Iron is soft and weak until
carbon and metals such as chromium and nickel are
added to make a hard alloy, steel. These two metals
also protect the steel from being “eaten away.”
Brass is an alloy made of copper and zinc. Musical
instruments made from brass, such as trumpets, have
a bright sound quality. Bronze, a long lasting alloy, is
made of copper and tin.

Medical tools are made of an alloy
of tungsten. This alloy allows the
tools to be razor sharp.

People who lived in the Bronze
Age knew how make bronze.

Salts

What is a salt?
You sprinkle it on food. It looks like little grains.
What is it? It’s table salt. There are actually many
kinds of salt. Table salt is just one kind of salt. It is a
compound called sodium chloride.
A salt is any compound made of a metal and a
nonmetal. In sodium chloride, sodium is the metal and
chlorine is the nonmetal.
The particles that make up salt are lined up in
orderly rows. This orderly arrangement gives salts a
boxlike shape and makes them hard. It’s hard to melt
salts. They have high melting points. Table salt melts
at 801°C (1,474°F)!

Making Salts
One way to make salts is to mix two compounds
called an acid (A•sed) and a base. See that the acid in
the diagram has chlorine (Cl) in it. The base has sodium
(Na). When the two compounds react, the Na and Cl
join to became NaCl (salt).
When salts are dissolved in water the metal particles
and nonmetal particles break apart. They have electric
charges (+ and –):
Na+ + Cl–

NaCl (in water)

These charged particles carry electricity through
water. So a mixture of salt and water can be a good
conductor. However, some salts do not dissolve well in
water. They do not make good conductors when added
to water.

An orange tastes sour. Squeeze a drop of orange juice
on litmus (LIT•muhs) paper. Lemon juice makes the paper
turn red.
Litmus paper is an indicator (IN•duh•kay•duhr). An
indicator changes color in ways to help you tell what a
substance is. The red color indicates that orange juice
is an acid. An acid is a substance that tastes sour and
turns litmus paper red. Be careful: Never taste unfamiliar
substances to tell if they are acids.
Other acids are lemon juice and vinegar. The formula
for any acid starts with H (hydrogen). For example,
hydrochloric acid is HCl. When you mix an acid and
water, hydrogen particles are formed. The hydrogen
particles have an electric charge. They conduct
electricity through water.

Bases
Soap and ammonia cleaner
contain bases. A base is a
substance that tastes bitter and
turns litmus paper blue. Bases
feel slippery, like soap. Be careful:
Never taste or feel unfamiliar
substances to tell if they are bases.
The formula for a base ends in
OH (oygen + hydrogen). When a
base is added to water, a charged
particle is formed from the OH.
These charged particles carry
electricity in water.
base + water

When an acid is mixed with a
base, they form a salt. The acid
supplies the nonmetal part of the
salt. The base supplies the metal
part.
Acids and bases neutralize
(NEW•truh•lyze) each other.
Neutralize means “to cancel each
other out.” That is, the salt that is
produced is not an acid or a base.

How strong are acids and bases?
Some acids are stronger than others. For example,
a strong acid can wear away a hole in metal quickly.
Vinegar on the other hand is a weak acid. It’s weak
enough for you to use on a salad with no effect.
Some bases are stronger than others. For example,
lye is a strong base in drain cleaners. It can “eat away”
a clog in a drain quickly.
The strength of acids and bases is measured on a pH
scale. The scale runs from 0 (strong acid, weak base)
to 14 (strong base, weak acid). A rating of 7, right in the
middle, is neutral—neither acid nor base.

Reading Diagrams
At low pH (acids), there are more H+ than OH -.
At high pH (bases), there are more OH - than H+. At 7,
there are equal numbers of both.

Changes in Matter

Reading the pH Scale
Strong acids form many charged hydrogen
particles (H+) when added to water. They have very
few OH- particles. For example, an acid with a pH
of 0 or 1 forms many more H+ than an acid with a
pH of 5 or 6.
Strong bases have very few H+ particles in water.
They form, instead, many OH- particles. Bases with
a pH of 13 or 14 have many more OH- particles than
a base with a pH of 8 or 9.
Water has a pH of 7. It has about the same
number of H+ and OH- particles. Water is neutral.
That is, it is neither an acid nor a base.
Scientists use meters to measuring the pH of
water and soil. A pH near 0 (very acid) can be very
harmful for living things in a lake or river. Most
plants grow best when the soil has a pH over
7 (base) rather than under (acid).

Hydrangeas have blue ﬂowers when
grown in soil that has a pH under 7
(acid). They have pink ﬂowers when
the pH of the soil is above 7 (base). C

Quick Check
Write acid or base next to each description.
25. pH under 7
26. More H+ particles than OH- particles
27. pH over 7

How do we use salts?
Salt was used as money in some ancient
cultures. Why was it so valuable? In days when
there were no freezers, salt kept foods from
spoiling. Salts remove water from foods. Bacteria
cannot survive in foods dried with salt. Fish has
been packed in salt in many places for centuries.
Salt is used for seasoning. Small amounts of salt
along with other flavorings give many meals a rich
flavor. Salt is also used for curing meats and baking.
It is used for canning foods and pickling foods.
Salt is also very useful in icy weather. If you
spread salt onto ice, it dissolves into the ice and
lowers the freezing point. The ice turns to slush or
water and is easy to remove.

Mummies were dried in salt by ancient
people of Egypt. A number of them have
remained preserved for over 2,000 years.

198
Changes in Matter

Salt spreaders are hard at work to ease the
removal of snow and ice from the road.

Getting Salt
Combining an acid and a base
makes a salt. However, to meet our
need for salt, we collect salt that is
already made in nature.
Salt was formed early in Earth’s
history. It was dissolved by rain and
ended up in the oceans. Today, there
are as much as 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) of salt
in every 100 kg (220 lb) of ocean
water.
In many places today, ocean
water is drawn into shallow pools.
Exposed to the Sun, the water
evaporates. The salt remains behind.

These sea side pools are used
for getting salt.

Early in Earth’s history, salt
remained behind when shallow
inland seas dried up. Over time
the salt was buried by sediments.
We can get this salt by pumping
water down into the salt. The water
becomes salty. We collect the water
and let it evaporate. The salt remains
behind.

Quick Check
Write true or false for each sentence.
Correct any false statement.
28. Salt evaporates from ocean water.
29. Salt raises the freezing point of water.
30. Salt can preserve foods.
